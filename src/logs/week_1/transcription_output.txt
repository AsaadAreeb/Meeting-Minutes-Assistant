thank you very much mr. president  today we mourn the passing of Coretta Scott King and when I think about Coretta Scott King I think about little girl who walked 5 miles to school  on those rural Alabama roads and felt the heat of racism each day she passed the door of the whites only school so much closer to home  it didn't matter because she studied and it succeeded and excelled Beyond most of her classmates black and white she earned a college degree and an acceptance to a prestigious Graduate School of North  and one day she met a young preacher from Atlanta and she fell in love with  and he told her his drinks and she believed in those drinks and she decided that you would help to make them real not just as a wife or as a friend but as a partner in Freedom's cost  over the next year is Coretta Scott King did that in so many ways we can't even imagine she raise the family she marched through the streets she inspired through song she went through speech even Dodge the countless attempts on her family's life  and one when one of those attempts finally took her love from this world she made the selfless decision to carry on with no time to even cry or more swallowing anger or Vengeance Coretta Scott King took to the streets just four days after the assassination and led 50,000 through the streets of Memphis in a March for the kind of justice that her husband had given his life for  she fed the rest of your time here Marching for that same Justice leading the King Center for nonviolent social change in Atlanta and spreading her family's message of Hope every corner of this world  Dell I had the great honor of knowing mrs. king and the occasion to visit with her in Atlanta  last year  she was extraordinary the gracious woman we sat and chatted and her living room we she showed me an album of photographs of her and dr. king and the children  and then she told me what her husband had said to her once at a time when she was feeling burdened understandably by all the stress and strain that had been placed on the family as a consequence of his role in the Civil Rights Movement she said her husband suggested that when you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cross  you will never be alone  because you will have Divine companionship and the support of good people  I was her husband's advice to her that when you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cause you will never be alone  Coretta Scott King died in her sleep last night she certainly was not alone  she was joined by the companionship and support of a loving family and a Grateful Nation inspired by her cause dedicated to her work and mournful of her passing my thoughts and condolences today are with her children  and I asked that she and her husband now rest together in Eternal peace  about today mr. president I'm also introducing a resolution honoring the life and contributions of Coretta Scott King I'll be hopeful that all my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort thank
